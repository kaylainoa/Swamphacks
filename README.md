# Inspiration: 
The primary motivation behind the development of this website was to ensure women have access to abortion clinics during these times. 

# What it does: 
We aimed to provide not only a system for locating nearby clinics but also a supportive chatbot and educational map to address questions about abortion and reproductive rights.

# How we built it:
We divided the tasks as some of us worked on the front end and UI, while others worked on back end and data fetching. A lot of us collaborated when we ran into errors in our individual "departments" and helped each other problem-solve.

# Challenges we ran into: 
The main challenges we faced while building our project involved using OpenAI and GenAI. Our goal was to use these AI systems to increase the complexity of our project and provide a better user experience. While implementing these systems, we received various errors concerning API keys and UI design, but by researching more on the topic and working together, we got through the challenges and created a final product. 

# Accomplishments that we're proud of:
We're proud of getting a successful chatbot and getting a working map that is able to relocate its display to a specific zip code and is capable of fetching nearby clinic information. In addition, the website overall is a great accomplishment, and a sign on how we pushed through despite our difficulties. 

# What we learned: 
By participating in this hackathon, we learned how to use React.js, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS for UI design, and integrate APIs. Ultimately, we developed the necessary skills to create a website with different properties and polished our frontend abilities. 

# What's next for My Body My Place: 
It would be amazing if we got time to further develop this site, in addition to expanding our site to beyond the united states. Perhaps a less glitchy version of our United States map at the bottom, but it is quite helpful to have direct access to these resources all in one place.
